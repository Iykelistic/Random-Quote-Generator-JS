### Made with:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

### Changelog: 
* 22/08/2017: Added transition to background
* 20/08/2017: Pick unique new quote and color scheme on 'Next' button click. (No same quote or color scheme can be picked in a row)

### Bugs:
* CSS `transition` property on `<body>` seems to also apply transitions to descendant text elements `<p>`, `<q>`, and even `<a>` but with delay. Not sure why this is or how to fix it other than to remove the property. (Tested on Chrome, Vivaldi, Opera, & Firefox. Seems this is not an issue in Firefox)
